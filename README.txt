Please note the following:

	1. Exist two optional layouts on the project switching by only one class:
		a) class="left-sidebar-layout"
		b) class="right-sidebar-layout"

	2. The website renders and behaves correctly on the newest versions of the popular Web browsers. It also behaves well (not equal to) on the old versions of browsers until IE7 excluding IE6.

	3. The content slider used is functionally working. It's made on jQuery UI.
	
	4. There is no Responsive Design used on the current project.
